## Overview  
**Integrate** is an all-in-one software solution for K-12 schools that consolidates the functions of disparate educational management tools.

### Challenge

Design a **data and analytics tool** to help K-12 administrators better manage their schools and track information about students—**balancing administrative needs with student well-being**.


### Solutions

- A **lightweight, intuitive, customizable dashboard** with widgets, benchmarking, and notifications  
- **Custom flags** for tracking user-defined metrics


### Roles & Team

**My roles:** Competitive Analysis, Interviews, Wireframing, UI Design, Prototyping  
**Team:** Sharone Bloom, Eduardo Crespo, Melissa Gerson

## Research

Integrate lacked a dedicated analytics tool for administrators. We set out to understand their needs and how competitors addressed similar problems.

### Competitive Analysis
We evaluated competitor data tools to understand the landscape and positioning opportunities for Integrate.  
**What we learned:** Integrate’s simplicity and blended functionality could be leveraged. A **moderately complex yet clear, easy-to-use tool** appeared to be the way forward.

### Interviews & Synthesis
We interviewed school administrators to learn about their experiences with educational software and which information they value when managing schools.

We synthesized findings into a **persona** and a **user journey map**:

## Design

We focused on core needs uncovered in research, including attention to **students’ life circumstances beyond numeric metrics**.

### Ideation
Each team member sketched concepts; we discussed and selected features to include.

### Wireframes & Prototype
With ideas locked in, we produced wireframes and an initial interactive prototype.

### User Testing
We uncovered issues around **discoverability of benchmarking** and the **relevance of preset widgets**.  
Custom **flags** tested well but needed more detailed information.

We iterated into a second prototype to address these concerns. Testing was cut short at the client’s request, so we advanced to a final round of changes and a high-fidelity prototype.

## High-Fidelity Prototype

We adapted the changes into a third prototype that aligned visually with the rest of the Integrate product. We refined layouts for the dashboard and **widget creation/edit** flows.

## Reflection / Next Steps

- Expand benchmarking **onboarding and affordances** for discoverability  
- Improve **widget presets** based on role and school priorities  
- Enrich **flag details** and history for deeper context around student well-being
