## Overview

Redesign to help Catholics find Mass times and locations

Mass Times helps Catholics find the times and locations of Masses and other worship services. They keep a crowdsourced database of parish info/schedules and are sustained by donations.

## Problems

- Finding worship service times was time-consuming and difficult  
- The accuracy of parish info was not trustworthy  
- Users couldn't get a sense of the qualities of a parish before visiting  
- The UI seemed unappealing and confusing at times

## Solutions

- Additional options for filtering/sorting  
- Channels for adding/updating parish information were made prominent and simple  
- Tag-review system and photos in parish info pages  
- Visual/UI design for currentness, clarity, and legibility

## Research

I set out to validate my assumptions that the process of searching/sorting through results was lacking and that parish information was often dated/inaccurate.

### Survey

A survey was sent out to gather information about site usage, users's experiences, and opinions.

### Interviews

I learned the contexts and situations in which the site and its alternatives are used, and collected pain points in the search process on-site and off-site.

#### Pain points pertaining to Mass Times

- Lack of sorting/filtering options  
- Results were hard to read and time-consuming to browse  
- UI/visual design described as confusing, unpleasant, dated, or unfamiliar  
- Info often missing/incorrect; users felt they had to verify accuracy  
- No indication of last update to info

#### General Pain Points

- Limited ways to get a better sense of what a parish was like  
- Difficulty in finding parishes that match individual preferences  
- Having a bad experience while visiting a parish

## Personas & User Journeys

Two priorities emerged: the desire for **specific qualities** and **convenience**. These translated into distinct personas with respective journey maps.

## Design

With user types in mind, I set out to optimize the site for convenience and to help users select a parish they would feel comfortable visiting.

### Tag Reviews

In line with user feedback, a review system employing preset tags was developed. These gave a qualitative overview of a parish with low abuse potential. (*Inspired by Leafly.*)

### User Testing

User tests mostly revealed flaws in the desktop design, though both desktop and mobile versions suffered from lack of contrast and legibility.

## Final Prototypes

## Notes on Visual Design

- Reflect a contemporary visual experience  
- Logo, colors, and typography refreshed for currency  
- Layout and visual hierarchy of results were modified for clarity and legibility

## Final Thoughts

The design was shared with the Mass Times Trust, and they implemented aspects of it. If I had been able to test with a larger number of users, I would perform card sorting to refine the review tags.
