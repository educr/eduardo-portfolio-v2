## Iterations 1–2

I helped design a poster telling the story from the start through the second iteration.

  caption="Poster summarizing key decisions across the first two iterations."

It was presented at MSK’s 2024 **Quality Improvement Symposium**, where we won the **first place Award of Distinction**.

## Iteration 3

While the new illustrations improved comprehension, they needed to match MSK’s newly released illustration style.  
For brand consistency, the patient guide adopted MSK’s nascent illustration style.
