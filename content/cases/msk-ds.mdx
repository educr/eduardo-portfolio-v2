## Overview

A system for healthcare consumers and professionals alike.  
The **MSK Design System** supports digital products for patients and specialized healthcare staff.

### Challenge

Build a design system that meets the needs of designers *and* developers working on products for users with vastly different needs.

### Solutions

- Headless design system with semantic tokens
- Pro and Consumer modes

### Team
Design System Team (within UX)

## Early Days

The MSK Design System began as a modification of IBM’s Carbon Design System (in Figma + code). Initially workable, but as usage expanded, we ran into problems: what worked for consumer-facing apps failed for dense clinical UIs.

We introduced **dual style strategies**:

- **Gotham** for large consumer-facing typographic elements  
- **Source Sans Pro** for small-scale staff interfaces  

---

## Tokens & Theming

We created semantic tokens and organized them for ease of consumption. These tokens enabled:

- Light / dark modes  
- “Consumer mode” vs “Pro / Staff mode” density adjustments  
- Brand consistency across technologies (Ant Design, Gradio, Flutter, web)

## Headless Evolution

As adoption grew, MSK evolved from a Carbon fork to a **headless design system**. Key changes:

- A new proprietary typographic system: **MSK Sans**  
- Size, spacing, and typographic tokens that adjust per mode (consumer vs pro)  

This flexibility lets you theme the same component library differently depending on user profile (e.g. higher density UI for staff).

## Mode Toggle

You can switch between:

1. **Light / Dark mode**  
2. **Consumer / Pro (staff) mode**

Each mode uses different densities, font sizes, and spacing rules to optimize for its audience.

## What I’d Do Next

- Expand component library with more domain-specific UI 
- Create components for AI features
