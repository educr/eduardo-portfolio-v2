## Overview

The **MSK Design System** was built to unify digital experiences across Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.  
It serves two radically different audiences:

- **Patients and caregivers** navigating healthcare services  
- **Clinical staff** who need dense, efficient interfaces  

The system provides a shared foundation for designers and developers, ensuring **consistency, adaptability, and long-term scalability**.

## Challenge

How do you create a **single design system** that works for:

- Consumer-facing apps that must be welcoming, accessible, and brand-aligned  
- Professional clinical tools that demand density and precision
- Developers and designers across the organization using disparate components, styles, and processes

---

## Solutions

- **Headless architecture with semantic tokens** for flexibility  
- **Dual role-based modes**: Consumer (patients) and Pro (staff)  
- **Custom typography and spacing strategies** tuned to each mode  
- **Cross-technology compatibility** (React/Ant Design, Gradio, Flutter, web)

**Team:** MSK Design System Team (within UX)

## Early Days

The project began as a fork of **IBM’s Carbon Design System** (Figma + code).  
While Carbon gave us a strong base, it quickly showed limitations:

- Large typography was effective for patient-facing apps but **inefficient for staff tools**  
- Clinical apps required **higher density** to minimize scrolling and interaction costs  

Our solution: a **dual style strategy**.

- **Gotham** → friendly, large-scale typography for consumer apps  
- **Source Sans Pro** → compact, legible typeface for staff interfaces

## Tokens & Theming

We introduced a **semantic token taxonomy** (color, and in later iterations, size, spacing, typography) enabling:

- Light & dark modes  
- Consumer vs. Pro density adjustments  
- Brand consistency across platforms

Tokens became the backbone for adaptability — a **single source of truth** powering multiple app families.

## Headless Evolution

As adoption grew, we transitioned from a Carbon fork to a **headless, MSK-owned system**.

    {

      alt: ''
    },
    {

      alt: ''
    },
        {
      src: '/cases/msk-ds/button.png',
      alt: ''
    }
  ]}

Key milestones:

- **MSK Sans** → proprietary typographic system (courtesy of the Brand team) balancing readability and brand  
- **Adaptive tokens** → scale & spacing shift automatically by mode  
- **Mode-aware components** → same codebase, optimized differently for each audience

</figure>

This unlocked **new flexibility**: developers could build once, and the system adapted depending on whether the user was a patient or clinician.

## Mode Toggle

The system supports seamless switching between:

1. **Light / Dark mode**  
2. **Consumer / Pro mode**

Each configuration applies unique density, spacing, and typography rules.

## Impact

- **Adoption across teams**: multiple product groups standardized on MSK DS  
- **Improved patient apps**: approachable typography and layouts  
- **Developer velocity**: design system improved consistency & speed without sacrificing visual consistency

## What I’d Do Next

- Expand the library with **domain-specific components**  
- Introduce UI components for **AI-driven features**
