## Overview 

**PlanQ** is a radiation-oncology tool serving multiple roles across clinical care.

I helped expand it to a new user group, reduce design debt, and unify inconsistent UI patterns. I created new, decluttered views to handle dense data and helped introduce AI-assisted features in a high-risk clinical context.

## Team
Cross-departmental collaboration with design lead Jackie Denmark, medical physics, and clinical staff.

## Challenges

- The existing tool served some radiation therapy related roles but needed to expand to **radiation therapists**.  
- Therapists's existing workflows without PlanQ required redundant **clicking and context-switching**
- **No designers** had ever worked on the project, leading to heavy design debt.  
- The dashboard’s **large table had too many columns**, requiring constant side-scrolling.  
- Needed to **introduce and differentiate AI features** in a high-risk clinical context.

## Process

The project demanded close collaboration with both clinical staff and engineers. **We kicked off our time together with a workshop**.

      alt: '',
    }
  ]}

We proceeded with a **visual design audit and heuristic evaluation**, recognizing usability issues and inconsistencies across the interface. From there, I assisted with creating a foundation for **consistent design standards** that would scale as the product evolved.

We then conducted **on-site research** at MSK's Main Campus and a regional site, observing how radiation therapists worked in real clinical environments. 

### These studies revealed:
- Labyrinthine workflows
- Excessive clicking and window switching
- Role-specific needs and gap not met by existing systems
- Moments where visual hierarchy failed

      alt: '',
    }
  ]}

### Moving on
- I partnered with clinical staff to gather **data requirements**, mapping what information was critical at different steps of their workflow. 
- In parallel, I worked with **developers** to understand technical constraints, such as how PlanQ could or could not interact with existing clinical systems's APIs. This dialogue helped balance **ambition with feasibility**, ensuring the designs respected integration limits while still aiming for meaningful improvements.  

To validate early concepts, we built **interactive Figma prototypes** and ran **user testing sessions with real therapists**. These sessions provided direct insights into usability and trust, guiding refinements before handoff.

## Solutions

### General
- **Visual design reconciliation** to reduce clutter and unify the interface.  

### Dashboard
- **Dashboard views tailored** to different radiation therapy tasks.  
- Introduced a **card view** alongside the table view — supporting scannable workflows for therapists while retaining dense data for physicists.

### Patient Details
- Developed a **distinct style** for AI-generated or AI-flagged content, balancing clarity with clinical safety.

## Impact

Although I left MSK before the designs went into production, **user testing yielded encouraging results**:  

- Some therapists reported that they **preferred the card view**.  
- While there was **healthy skepticism toward AI features**, some therapists acknowledged potential value if used with thorough caution.  
- Filtering **helped therapists quickly locate the data they needed**.  
- The design garnered **positive sentiment** among therapists seeing a tool shaped directly around their needs.  

<div className="my-5 rounded-[28px] border border-white/40 bg-white/80 p-8 shadow-lg">
  <blockquote className="text-xl font-semibold leading-relaxed text-fg">
    "I will tell you that I was a little bit skeptical when I heard about this…but [using it today], I can honestly say like this is very useful for us. I can see why it's useful and why it was put into effect or is being worked on. It is better than I expected, and it is a lot more than I expected."
  </blockquote>
</div>

Meanwhile, developers appreciated that the proposed solutions were **grounded in API and integration realities**, which eased adoption discussions.  

- The team adopted **more consistent visuals**, making for a more unified product.  
- In principle, once the new dashboard was deployed there would be smoother transitions between different tasks.

## Reflection

This project highlighted the importance of **direct observation in clinical settings**. Many of the most impactful design improvements came not from interviews but from **watching therapists work under real conditions**.  

It also reinforced the value of **early engagement with both clinicians and engineers**. By bridging the gap between **workflow requirements** and **technical feasibility**, we ensured the design was not only desirable but also possible.  

Most importantly, the **user testing feedback confirmed impact even before release**. Seeing therapists’ excitement — and their cautious optimism toward AI — underscored the importance of involving end-users in the design process.
