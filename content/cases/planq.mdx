## Overview

**PlanQ** is a radiation-oncology tool used by clinicians to plan and coordinate patient care. The project aimed to extend its use to **radiation therapists**, while addressing accumulated design debt and improving usability across existing roles.

---

## Role & Scope

I worked on:
- Expanding the tool to a new user group (radiation therapists)  
- Reconciling design inconsistencies and visual debt  
- Simplifying dense data views  
- Introducing AI-assisted features within a high-risk clinical context  
- Adding a notifications feature  

This work built on close collaboration between design, clinical, and engineering teams to ensure the product balanced **clinical trust** and **technical feasibility**.

---

## Challenges

- No prior design involvement had led to **heavy UI debt** and unclear hierarchy.  
- The tool’s **main dashboard table** had dozens of columns and required side-scrolling.  
- **Therapists’ workflows** involved repetitive clicking and constant window switching.  
- Needed to safely introduce **AI-flagged data** into a high-risk environment.  
- Expansion required **new views and interactions** without disrupting existing users.  
- There was no notification system surfacing relevant changes or situations

---

## Workshop

We began with a **multi-disciplinary workshop** involving clinical staff, engineers, and design leads to align goals and capture pain points.

## Visual Audit and Reconciliation

We conducted a **heuristic evaluation and UI audit**, identifying issues in layout, color hierarchy, and spacing. This foundation informed a **unified visual framework** that could scale with the product.

### Outcomes
- Unified typography, spacing, and components across views.  
- Established a scalable color system and consistent iconography aligned with MSK’s design system.

## Notifications

We worked closely with existing users through regular discussions to understand what sorts of notifications would be of value to them.

### Outcomes
- Notifications for different roles with varying types, priorities, actions, and displayed data
- Various forms of customization and management

## Expanding to a New Role

### On-Site Research

We visited **MSK’s main campus and regional centers** to observe radiation therapists in real conditions.  
These studies revealed:
- Labyrinthine workflows and redundant steps  
- Poor differentiation of task priorities  
- Visual overload and poor use of hierarchy  
- Gaps in existing data views

    { src: '/cases/planq/observation-4.jpg', alt: '' },
    { src: '/cases/planq/observation-5.jpg', alt: '' },
    { src: '/cases/planq/observation-6.jpg', alt: '' },

### Co-Design & Prototyping

Partnering with therapists, we mapped data priorities across workflow stages. In parallel, we collaborated with developers to ensure **integration feasibility** with existing APIs.

We prototyped and tested **interactive Figma flows** with real therapists to validate clarity, data comprehension, and trust in AI-assisted insights.

---

### Dashboard Redesign

- Introduced **role-aware dashboard views**, tailored to therapists’ tasks.  
- Added **card and table views** — allowing users to toggle between dense data and scannable summaries.  
- Improved information grouping and alignment.

### AI Integration

- Defined a **distinct style language** for AI-flagged content.  
- Balanced prominence and caution through subtle visual cues to maintain clinical trust.

## Impact

Although I left before implementation, **user testing showed strong early validation**:

- Therapists preferred the **card view** for quick scanning.  
- They expressed **measured optimism** toward AI features when paired with transparency.  
- Filtering improved task speed and clarity.  
- Developers reported smoother alignment due to the **documented visual standards**.

    “I was skeptical at first, but after using it, I can see how this really helps us. It’s more useful — and more thoughtful — than I expected.”
  </blockquote>
</div>

## Reflection

PlanQ reinforced the value of **embedded observation in clinical environments** — the most actionable insights emerged not from interviews but from watching therapists work under pressure.

It also underscored the importance of **early cross-functional alignment**. Engaging clinicians and engineers from the start allowed us to design solutions that were **desirable, feasible, and safe** — strengthening both user trust and implementation success.
